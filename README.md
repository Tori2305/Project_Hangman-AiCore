## Introduction 
This project is part of the AI Core curriculum and aims to build a Hangman game. Users can guess letters to figure out a randomly selected word from a list of words.


## Features 
- Randomly select a word from a list of words
- Allow users to guess letters
- Display the current state of the word with correctly guessed letters
- Track the number of lives remaining
- Provide feedback on whether the guessed letter is in the word
- End the game when the user either guesses the word or runs out

## **Description**
The aim of the project is to test the skills learned so far throughout my AiCore training course. Including; all data types, while,for and if loops, error handling and object orientation programming to name but a few. 

## **Learnings**
1. Python Programming - Ability to write and understand Python code, including the use of classes, functions, and control structures.
2. Object Orientation Programming - Understand OOP principals including encapsulation, inheritance, and the use of docstrings & comments.
3. Problem-Solving - Logically thinking about checking user input, updating the game state and handling game logic.
4. Code refactoring - Improving the readability and structure of my code, making it more maintainable and easier to understand.
5. User Input Handling - Effectively handling user input, including validation and feedback, which is essential for creating interactive applications.
6. Randomisation - Ability to use Python random module demonstrating ability to work with external libraries.
7. Documentation - Using clear and concise dostrings and comments helping others to understand purpse and use of my code.

## Usage
WIP

## **Usage instructions**
Play as it is or if you'd like to change parts of the game, you can amend the following: 
- Change the number of tries a user has see *line 47*
- Change the words for the computer to choose from, see list in line 2, be sure to rename the variable if fruit is no longer relevant. (You will also need to change this on *line 56* when you call the function play_game. 


## **File structure of the project**
Workings towards the game are all saved in the folder **'hangman_workings'**
The game itself is saved as **'play_the_game'**
