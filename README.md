## Introduction

This project is part of the AI Core curriculum and aims to build the classic game of Hangman. An implementation of the game, whereby the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.


## Features
- Use of Python basis commands such as if-else statements and while loops to create variables for the game.
- C


## **Description**
The aim of the project is to test the skills learned so far throughout my AiCore training course. Including; all data types, while,for and if loops, error handling and object orientation programming to name but a few. 

## **Learnings**
- The use of self. within the class and how to call on this when you're outside that class.
- Formatting clearly so that code is easily followed and edited if necessary.
- Learned how to handle errors and implement changes to fix.
- Sanity print statement checks ;)

## Installation instructions

## **Usage instructions**
Play as it is or if you'd like to change parts of the game, you can amend the following: 
- Change the number of tries a user has see *line 47*
- Change the words for the computer to choose from, see list in line 2, be sure to rename the variable if fruit is no longer relevant. (You will also need to change this on *line 56* when you call the function play_game. 


## **File structure of the project**
Workings towards the game are all saved in the folder **'hangman_workings'**
The game itself is saved as **'play_the_game'**
