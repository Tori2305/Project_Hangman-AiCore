## Introduction 
This project is part of the AI Core curriculum and aims to build a Hangman game. Users can guess letters to figure out a randomly selected word from a list of words.


## Features 
- Randomly select a word from a list of words
- Allow users to guess letters
- Display the current state of the word with correctly guessed letters
- Track the number of lives remaining
- Provide feedback on whether the guessed letter is in the word
- End the game when the user either guesses the word or runs out

## Description
The aim of the project is to test the skills learned so far throughout my AiCore training course. Including; all data types, while,for and if loops, error handling and object orientation programming to name but a few. 

## Learnings

**Python Programming** - Ability to write and understand Python code, including the use of classes, functions, and control structures.

**Object Orientation Programming** - Understand OOP principals including encapsulation, inheritance, and the use of docstrings & comments.

**Problem-Solving** - Logically thinking about checking user input, updating the game state and handling game logic.

**Code refactoring** - Improving the readability and structure of my code, making it more maintainable and easier to understand.

**User Input Handling** - Effectively handling user input, including validation and feedback, which is essential for creating interactive applications.

**Randomisation** - Ability to use Python random module demonstrating ability to work with external libraries.

**Documentation** - Using clear and concise dostrings and comments helping others to understand purpse and use of my code.

## Usage

1. **Initilaise the game**
   - Install the dependencies
   
           Bash
           pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   - Create an instance of the `Hangman` class
   - Call the `play_game` function to start the game
  
2. **Play the Game**
   - Run the script to play the game
   - Customise the number of tries and word list as needed.
